    Reconstruct full reward matrix

    This is achieved by sometimes picking a strongly peaked probability distribution, such that we can be fairly
    certain about what the predictor predicted. When we update, we know the actual action and the predicted action
    and are therefore able to update the correct entry of the reward matrix.
    Even with a strongly peaked distribution, we will sometimes not chose the most likely action. This allows us to
    access the off-diagonal entries. As this rarely happens, learning the off-diagonal rewards is relatively slow. To
    speed up learning, we prefer to use sample averages, rather than Q-learning.

    When exploiting, we compute the optimal distribution based on the current estimate of the reward matrix. This
    distribution may be non-deterministic.

    Arguments:
        learning_rate: Learning rate for Q-learning or None (or negative value) to use sample averages
